This project is a parametric three-band equalizer (EQ) audio plug-in developed in C++ using the JUCE framework, following the excellent tutorial by @matkatmusic on YouTube ([link to tutorial](https://youtu.be/i_Iq4_Kd7Rc)). The project configuration was managed through Projucer.

Features:

- Three-band EQ with low, mid, and high frequency controls
- Real-time frequency shaping using IIR filters
- Gain control for each band
- Built using modern C++ practices and JUCE's audio plug-in architecture
- Exportable as VST/AU plug-in

This project is ideal for learning JUCE fundamentals and building real-time audio processing tools for music production and sound design.
